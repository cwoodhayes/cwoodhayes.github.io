Hands-on robotics and embedded systems engineer with extensive experience building & deploying real-world hardware and software to spacecraft, medical devices, and consumer products. 

Currently studying for an [MS in Robotics at Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/), focusing on robotic manipulation, perception, and embodied AI/ML.

In addition to my technical work, I also am passionate about art and product development;  I enjoyed building and running my own startup-focused consulting company for 2 years, and have had a successful side career as a recording artist. 

My philosophy is that **while any capable person can make change, only a whole person can make change for the better.**
