# I ran a consulting business for 2 years.

I supported 5 clients on 7 projects from 2022-2025, ranging from 1 to 7 months long, operating under my company *Conor Hayes Software Consulting Inc* (an S-Corp I registered in Indiana).

Most of these are under some level of NDA, and all of the code is closed source, but have included work on:

- A parallelized hardware testing framework for use on spacecraft and nuclear fusion hardware
- High-level control software and databases to manage steps on a satellite assembly line
- BLE protocol optimization for mobile phone-connected medical sensors
- Ongoing DevOps and cloud architecture support, setting up CI/CD pipelines
- Computer vision support on a refueling robot for self-driving electric vehicles

My clients were all sourced through word-of-mouth and direct referral.

## Problems I solve:
- you're a start-up in early growth stages and want help conceptualizing your tech stack & establishing the scrappy engineering culture you need to keep up with rapid product & business changes
- you're short of senior engineers & need some quick help on design, code reviews, and mentorship
- you want to create a complex hardware-software product, but are having trouble estimating scope, creating a timeline, or kicking off design & development
- your engineering team is struggling to deliver due to a technical or cultural gap between electrical, firmware, and software engineers, and you need someone to span the gap
- you're experiencing engineering churn due to frequent changes in product direction, or you're taking on significant technical risk without enough confidence that the end product will generate value
- you need experienced software help in these 3 areas: firmware development & bring-up; middleware for robotics & medical devices; cloud architecture, devops, and backend software development
