# Traveler IV - USC Rocket Propulsion Lab

## The first entirely student-designed, built, and launched rocket to fly to space

I helped lead RPL through this launch as the head of avionics, supervising all electronics and software used to manufacture & fly the vehicle.

I also led the effort to design the launch procedures, after procedural problems led to the failure of the [Traveler III](https://www.uscrpl.com/traveler-iii) rocket launch in 2018. 

Finally, after the launch, I supervised the effort to determine a flight path from the avionics data, and subsequently publish a [whitepaper](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/549ce89be4b0cddb26c4894b/t/5ce58210e4966b7fc63fbe10/1558544951210/Traveler-IV-Whitepaper) explaining our methodology.
