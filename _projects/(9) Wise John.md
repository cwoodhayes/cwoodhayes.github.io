I write, perform, and produce music & visual art under the stage name [Wise John](https://open.spotify.com/artist/13DmASWA762GpdaSAAR90l). 

*Stats:*
- **800k+ streams on Spotify**, and more on other streaming platforms
- **40+ Wise John shows** played in NYC, LA, and elsewhere
- **24 songs released** (1 album, 3 EP's)

- Musical contributions: songwriter, producer, vocals, piano, organ, synth, guitar, bass, drums. 
- Other contributions: bandleader, video editor, graphic designer, show booker, my own manager, etc etc

Sonically I'm most often compared to Father John Misty, Phoebe Bridgers, Radiohead, and Rufus Wainwright.

Aside from my artist project, I also enjoy playing jazz piano, both as a solitary pursuit as well as in combos & jam sessions. My favorite pianist is Bill Evans.

Music is & has always been a big part of my life, which exists in a complimentary fashion to my technical side. I bring the same creativity, dedication, and practical management style to both pursuits, and often find ways to translate lessons learned in one into the other.

## Some pieces I'm proud of:

        <div style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #666;">I generated this visual accompaniment to my song Fall of Rome using a GAN video generation script I wrote (see <a href="/projects/dreamgan">DreamGAN</a> for more).</div>
