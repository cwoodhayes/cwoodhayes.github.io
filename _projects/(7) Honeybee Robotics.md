# Honeybee Robotics - Exploration Robotics for Extreme Environments

**Summer 2018** - Software & Electrical Engineering Intern @ [Honeybee Robotics](https://www.honeybeerobotics.com/)

Provided ongoing project support & feature development for an in-house robotic control & testing framework built off of ROS, for projects including:

### Projects

- **NASA [Europa Lander](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/europa-lander/)** - Deep [drilling & sampling system](https://www.honeybeerobotics.com/products/drills/#1562267018150-cf7c081e-3ad71913-bc36)
- **NASA/Honeybee Robotics [Venus Drill](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7943906)** - Enabling sampling of the Venusian surface
- **NASA/Honeybee Robotics [PlanetVac](https://www.honeybeerobotics.com/news-events/planetvac-successfully-tested-on-sub-orbital-xodiac-rocket/)** - Suction-based regolith sampling system

I also designed, implemented, and fabricated a board for human-operated stepper motor control, for use in exploratory terrestrial drilling sites, as part of the IMDEX [Lab-at-rig system](https://www.csiro.au/en/research/production/materials/resource-characterisation-developments/lab-at-rig).

### Takeaways

- Absorbed a highly creative approach to sensor design & use
- Gained fluency in ROS & pub-sub networking
- Gained experience in digital & analog design + board layout with Altium
- Gained experience in software & hardware-based motor control
