# I ran a consulting business for 3 years.

I supported 5 clients on 7 projects from 2022-2025, ranging from 1 to 7 months long, operating under my company *Conor Hayes Software Consulting Inc* (an S-Corp I registered in Indiana).

Most of these are under some level of NDA, and all of the code is closed source, but have included work on:

- A parallelized hardware testing framework for use on spacecraft and nuclear fusion hardware
- High-level control software and databases to manage steps on a satellite assembly line
- BLE protocol optimization for mobile phone-connected medical sensors
- Ongoing DevOps and cloud architecture support, setting up CI/CD pipelines
- Computer vision support on a refueling robot for self-driving electric vehicles

My clients were all sourced through word-of-mouth and direct referral.

## I can help you if...
- you are struggling to estimate scope, create a timeline, or kick off design & development for a mixed hardware-software product.
- you are short on senior engineers & need occasional help on design, code reviews, and mentorship.
- your engineering team is struggling to deliver due to a technical or cultural gap between electrical, firmware, and software engineers.
- you are experiencing engineering churn due to frequent changes in product direction, or you're taking on significant technical risk without enough confidence that the end product will generate value.
- you need experienced software help in these 3 areas: firmware development & bring-up; middleware for robotics & medical devices; cloud architecture, devops, and backend software development
